### Hi there 👋

I'm Giacomo Mutti, EIT Digital master's student in Autonomous Systems, currently enrolled at Aalto University, Finland. 
 
Here you can find a series of team projects I've done during my bachelor's and master's studies. The main topics are related to 🤖 __**robotics**__ such 🔭 **Sensor fusion**, ✏️ **Mechanical design** but also something related to 📦 **Production line management**.
Feel free to hang arround and give a look.
